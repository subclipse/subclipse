<h1>SVN Resource History View</h1>
<p>
    This view is accessed via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Show in Resource
    History </span> context menu. Alternatively, to activate this view, choose <span class="menu">Window &gt; Open
    View &gt; Other...</span> and select <span class="name">SVN</span> ... <span class="name">SVN
    Resource History View</span>.

</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
    This view shows the history of a selected resource, as it exists in the SVN
        repository. In SVN, both files and directories are versioned and have
        a history. If the resource selected is in a <a href="glossary.html#working">working
        copy</a>, the revision currently checked out is highlighted (in bold
        face).
<p>
    The view itself consists of three distinct areas:
<ul>
    <li>
        The revision table showing revision numbers, date/time of revision, the
            name of the author, as well as the first line of the commit message.
            You can click on any revision to show its full details.
    </li>
    <li>
        The list of resources affected by this revision (modified, added, deleted
            or changed properties).
    </li>
    <li>
        The commit message for the selected revision.

<dl>
    <dt><img src="../images/nav-refresh.png" width="23" height="22"/> Refresh </dt>
    <dd>
        Refresh the contents of the current resource history display.

        By default, the resource history view only loads the revision table with
            the latest revisions. The number of revisions returned is
            set in the SVN preferences. This command retrieves the next block
            of revisions from the repository.
    </dd>
    <dt><img src="../images/nav-getall.png" width="23" height="22"> Get All</dt>
    <dd>
        This command will retrieve all revisions from the repository for the
            selected resource.
    </dd>
    <dt><img src="../images/btn-linktoeditor.png" width="23" height="22"> Link
        with Editor</dt>
    <dd>
        The <span class="name">SVN Resource History View</span> can be linked
        with the current editor. If linked, the content if the revision table
        changes when you switch the resource being edited. Showing resource history
        may be a longer running operation since it must retrieve the history
        from the repository. If working with a remote repository on a WAN or
        on the internet, you might want to turn off the "Link with Editor" button,
        or explicitly close or hide the view when switching between resources
        in the editor.
    </dd>
    <dt><img src="../images/btn-options.png" width="18" height="22"> Options</dt>
    <dd>

<h2>Context menu</h2>
<p>
    The context menu is available for any item listed in the revision table.
</p>
