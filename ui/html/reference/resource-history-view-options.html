<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Wrap Comments</h3>
<p>
    Toggle this option to have the commit commentary wrap within the confines
        of the commit panel.
</p>
<h3>Show Comments </h3>
<p>
    Toggles the display of commit comments on and off.
</p>
<h3>Show Affected Paths</h3>
<p>
    Toggles the display of the affected paths grid on and off.
</p>
<h3>Stop on Copy/Rename </h3>
<p>
    Toggles the option to stop the retrieval of resource history for an item
        on a copy or rename operation on and off.
</p>
<p>
    When the checked, the resource history will stop at the point that the selected
        file or folder was copied from somewhere else within the repository.
        This can be useful when looking at <a href="glossary.html#branch">branches</a> (or <a href="glossary.html#tag">tags</a>)
        as it stops at the root of that branch, and gives a quick indication
        of changes made in that branch only.
</p>
<h3>Flat</h3>
<p>
    Select this option to display the affected paths in a flat grid style. Where
        many files within a folder were changed as part of a revision, this view
        will show one entry for every changed file. It is the default view for
        the affected paths grid.

</p>
<h3>Compressed Folders</h3>
<p>
    Select this option to display the affected paths in a compressed folder (tree
        view) style. Where many files within a folder were changed as part of
        a revision, this view will show one compressed (collapsed) entry for
        each folder containing more than one changed file. The entry can then
        be expanded to show the individual files changed within that folder location.
